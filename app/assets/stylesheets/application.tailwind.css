/* because we've got checkbox that submit forms and navigate frames, i only wanna animate the
   checkboxes when they're clicked. otherwise you start the animation on click, then it runs again
   when the frame swaps content. this turns the animation off when they're unfocused, so they don't
   run on page / frame load. if you're animation is too long running, this'll still cause a weird
   reset when the frame swaps content, but default for daisy is 0.2s, so should most of the time
   finish before we swapping content. */
